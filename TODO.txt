MAIN GOALS:
>>One;
Have an implementation that allow us to remove the dependency and weight of the concrete logging framework on deployed escenarios.
Since we code to interfaces, we only need one concrete class and some interfaces in our main application. The rest should be loaded
at runtime if/as needed.
Perhaps we can use a workflow were we load a config XML and check what type of session we want. If is a "release" mode, we don't need
to load the shell.swf and the app does not resent. Or we can load a lighter one that only logs above WARN/ERROR to a DDBB...or whatever.

>>Two:
Create a remote debugging mechanism for two things.
We can pull the type fo session when we start, so debugging sessions would be dynamic.
Allow for


Remote configuration:
DefferedLogger:


>>ADD A CONFIG EXAMPLE WHERE WE SHOW ITS STRENGHTS.
We could have one logger on debug that points to a local DDBB and logs ALL levels, and have the same publisher that points to a different DDBB and logs above a
certain level.
